# SpaceBuster
Created this when i was 1st Year Computer science student.

A game i created using Pygame a python module.

I. Introduction

As a Computer Science Student my idea is to create a game using only Python programming language and not on game engine; so I can improve my understanding to algorithm and programming in general.
My main idea is to create a game that you can play to kill time. It should not be addicted nor taken seriously. I created a prototype of my game. And it’s called “Space Buster”, it is not exactly a finish product because it is a prototype but I have many ideas to improve it and make it a full-blown game that you can play to pass time.
The game I created is a space-shooting game. A user controls the spaceship, you can shot and you can move it. The main idea to the game is that you need to avoid or shot an asteroid and try to accomplish a higher score.

II. Problem or Idea

My games called “Space Buster” have no main menu nor prompt you to play again if you died. The idea is to create and implement a much better movement of user character. But as of right now what I wanted to do is create a main menu function.

III. Analysis

My analysis in my prototype is that it is neither fully functional nor full-blown game yet. But I’m trying to create and improve this game each time I have new ideas. The game right now is bland. There’s not much feature as of right now but you can play it even though it’s still prototype. The main idea of this game was already implemented, therefore you can play it.

IV. Improvements and what I intended to do

The first improvements I want to implement is the main menu and a function that if you died it ask you if you want to play again or not; the second improvement is I want to renew the movement and simple physics I implement in the prototype to make the movement much more fluid or smooth to the user eye. And to create a power-up, the power-up I can think right now is to a power-up that strengthen your ammo for small amount of time and a power-up that give you an extra life. Last thing what I intended to do is to make the user enjoy the game.
